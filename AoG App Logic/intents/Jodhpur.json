It was formerly the seat of a princely state of the same name. The capital of the kingdom was known as Marwar. Jodhpur is a popular tourist destination, featuring many palaces, forts and temples, set in the stark landscape of the Thar Desert.\n\nThe old city circles the fort and is bounded by a wall with several gates. However, the city has expanded greatly outside the wall over the past several decades."
